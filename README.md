# Open-MBIC
The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming reality; thus, finding solutions to the connection challenges in real-world scenarios is now of paramount importance.
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a very common protocol supported by both smartphones and lots of different objects, e.g., sensors.
In this work, we present an open-source library for Android devices that can be used to manages multiple BLE connections simultaneously.
A remote-monitoring system for clinical application is presented as an use case of Open-MBIC.
However, Open-MBIC remains a tools to easily extract raw data from different devices in a general IoT scenario.
